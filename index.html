        "Norfolk" is adapted from the MASON demo, "Gridlock", by Sarah Wise, Mark Coletti, and Andrew Crooks.
        It shows how to import GIS data, and how to move agents when they are limited to GIS defined paths.

        <p>The simulation starts by reading GIS data describing the road network of Norfolk.
            The simulation reads a .CSV file and places agents on the road network and assigns them destinations.
            The agents then head towards their destinations.
            Once they arrive, they return to their start points.
